## Introduction

There are many key parts to managing and finishing a project.

[README.md.](https://github.com/rachit-j/ww3#readme). This contains information to help someone get started with the project. 

[Project Plan](https://rachit-j.github.io/ww3/2023/11/15/project-proposal-presentation/). This contains a project plan and guide. This contains plan for the project and overviews the key elements of code.

[Issue Management](https://github.com/rachit-j/ww3/issues). Issues help drive the work of the project. Open issues are assigned to individuals. Closed issues contain history of work that has been completed.

[GitHub Pages Blog](https://rachit-j.github.io/ww3/). A big advantage of GitHub Pages as a frontend is that allows for classic frontend runtime and blogging to be contained in one place. In education, a huge part of our project is how it was made, and how we collaborated, and how we progressed through steps.

[SCRUM Board](https://app.clickup.com/9011012769/v/s/90110426250). Contains a timeline of how the project was completed and goals we passed through the creation of the project.
