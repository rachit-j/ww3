## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a sophisticated card game against a computer opponent, incorporating a unique twist on the classic game of War. Players will rearrange three cards instead of one, adding complexity and strategic depth. The project will serve as a platform to deepen understanding of Java programming, front-end development, and algorithmic analysis, focusing on Fibonacci sequences and sorting algorithms.

### Objectives

1. **Enhance Java Skills**: Gain a deeper understanding of abstract classes, inheritance, and various coding styles.
2. **Algorithm Development**: Create and analyze multiple algorithms for the card game and standard problems (Fibonacci sequence, sorting).
3. **Efficiency Analysis**: Study the efficiency of these algorithms using analytical measurements.
4. **Frontend Development**: Develop a frontend to visualize and present algorithmic processes and conclusions.
5. **Innovative Game Design**: Implement a unique twist in the card game to enhance player engagement.

### Project Phases

1. **Innovation Phase**: Conceptualize the card game rules and algorithmic challenges.
2. **Feature Development Phase**: Develop the game's core features and algorithmic solutions.
3. **Integration Phase**: Integrate the algorithms with the game and frontend.
4. **Finalization Phase**: Finalize the project with comprehensive analysis and polished frontend presentation.

### Specific Goals

#### A. Fibonacci Analysis

- Develop two additional methods to solve the nth result in the Fibonacci Sequence.
- Build a frontend output to display results and analysis.

#### B. Sorting Algorithm Analysis and Inheritance 

- Utilize an abstract class to evaluate the complexity and performance of several sorting algorithms (bubble, insertion, selection, and merge).
- Implement a parent class to track iterations, comparisons, merges/swaps, and timing.
- Analyze the Big O complexity, considering operations, time, and space.
- Conduct extensive testing (at least 12 runs with 5000 random elements each, excluding high and low outliers) to average results.
- Determine the most efficient sorting algorithm based on comparisons, swaps, complexity, and total time.

### Frontend Development

- Develop a console output for initial visualization.
- Design and implement a sophisticated frontend to display game mechanics and algorithmic analysis.
- Ensure the frontend can effectively present data through an API.

### Mockup and Design

- Create detailed mockups for the game interface and algorithmic visualization before coding.
- Design the frontend to be intuitive and visually engaging, enhancing the educational aspect.
